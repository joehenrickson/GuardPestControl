      <p>Joe was AMAZING. He was very professional and was able to come inspect our house within less than 
      24 hours of my initial request. He was thorough in searching our house for our rodent issue and it was 
      apparent that he is an expert. He explained everything to us in a respectful manner and helped us come 
      up with a "game plan" on how to prevent the rodent issue from ever happening again. I will be recommending 
      him to everyone I know who needs an exterminator!!<br><br></p>

      <p>Joe was very helpful and informative. He not only did a very detailed inspection of my 
      home, he also taught us what to look for in the future as well as what steps we can take in our 
      travels to help prevent bringing these insects home.<br>
      Thankfully we were bed bug free, however,
      I would have gladly used his services if needed. The process he uses for extermination is superior to any other 
      company I contacted before we chose this company.  I will recommend this company to my friends and family for their 
      exceptional services.<br><br></p>
